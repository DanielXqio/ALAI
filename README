# ALAI

Experiments around acoustic data transmission built on top of
[ggwave](https://github.com/ggerganov/ggwave).

## Backend

The FastAPI backend wraps the ggwave CLI utilities built from the upstream
sources (expected under `external/ggwave/build/bin/`).

### Setup

```bash
make build-ggwave
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
make serve
```

The API runs at http://127.0.0.1:8000. Interactive documentation is available
at http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs.

### Examples

Encode text into a WAV file:

```bash
curl -s "http://127.0.0.1:8000/encode?text=Hello" --output payload.wav
```

Decode the payload back into text:

```bash
curl -s -F "file=@payload.wav" http://127.0.0.1:8000/decode
```
